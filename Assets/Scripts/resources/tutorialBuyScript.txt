Welcome to NFT-Tinder! An app where you can make some profit while searching for the love of your life NFT.
I'll help you with all the basics you need to know for your search.
Since this is a tutorial, I disabled the timers for today.
To buy an NFT, you can press the right arrow key or the green button on the phone.
Good job! ... Although that one was questionable.
To pass on an NFT, you can press the left arrow key or the red button on the phone.
You're getting it! ... But you seriously have bad taste.
You're wondering how I know you have bad taste? Well look at the Trends!
The Trends can show you which ones are popular right now and which aren't.
Right now, there's only one trend to keep up with, but there's going to be more as you progress through the game.
Try swiping some and I'll tell you if you got them right!
If you think it's too confusing, you can look at the Recommender!
The greener the Recommender is, the more popular the NFT! But don't try to rely on it too much.
Try swiping more!
I see that your Hype bar is now full! You have now entered Fever Mode!
During Fever Mode, you are allowed to swipe faster and even get a hefty discount!!
See for yourself!
When Fever Mode is over, the Hype bar needs some time to cool off.
Buying NFT's increases the Hype, but if you let the Blue Timer run out, it will reset!
Ok that's all you need to know for buying. Let's sell the NFT's we bought!
