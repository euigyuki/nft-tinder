On this page, you can sell the NFT's you've bought and see how much profit or loss your choices made.
I prepared some extra NFT's for you in advance so that you can see how selling works.
On the right, you can see the Portfolio, or how many NFT's you are holding currently, and their current net worth.
Using the Phone in the middle, you can sell your NFT's however you like.
The NFT's are separated into three major parts: Face, Body, and Hat. There are four different types of each parts, making a total of 12 cards to choose from.
Each cards hold the information about the amount and the value of all NFT's with that type.
For example, looking at the green Face card, you can see that we have 8 NFT's that has a green face, and all of them is totaling up to $514.24.
Try clicking on this card!
Woah something popped up! Cards with green background show you how much profit you're making.
Try clicking on this card instead!
As you can tell, clicking on cards with red background shows you how much you are loosing.
The one with white background sell for the same amount that you originaly paid.
Maybe you can HODL some of these NFT's and try to shoot for the moon at a later day. You want diamond hands, not paper hands.
After you selected the cards, you can press the Sell button or Sell All button to sell all the NFT's you have.
Feel free to play around and I'll come back after you sell any NFT's!
